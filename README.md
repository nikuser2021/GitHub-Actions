# Introduction to GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that lets you automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository. You can create workflows that build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.

## Key Concepts

1. **Workflows**: Defined in YAML files in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. Workflows are triggered by events such as pushes, pull requests, or on a schedule.

2. **Events**: Triggers that can start workflows, like pushing code to a repository, creating a pull request, or scheduling a job.

3. **Jobs**: A job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner. Jobs run in parallel by default, but you can configure dependencies between jobs.

4. **Steps**: A step is an individual task that can run commands in a job. Steps can run shell commands or use actions.

5. **Actions**: Actions are reusable units of code that can be used to build, test, and deploy your projects.

## Getting Started with GitHub Actions

### Step 1: Create a Workflow

1. **Create the Workflow Directory**:
   In your repository, create a directory named `.github/workflows`.

2. **Create a Workflow File**:
   Inside the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file with a `.yml` extension. For example, `main.yml`.

### Step 2: Define the Workflow

Here’s a basic example of a workflow file that runs tests on a Node.js project:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x, 14.x, 16.x]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **name**: The name of the workflow.
2. **on**: Specifies the events that trigger the workflow. In this case, the workflow runs on `push` and `pull_request` events.
3. **jobs**: Defines a list of jobs. Each job runs on a separate runner.
4. **runs-on**: Specifies the type of runner the job will run on. `ubuntu-latest` is a commonly used runner.
5. **strategy.matrix**: Allows running multiple versions of Node.js by creating a matrix of different node versions.
6. **steps**: Lists the steps to be executed in the job.

## Common Actions

- **actions/checkout**: Checks out your repository under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so your workflow can access it.
- **actions/setup-node**: Sets up a specific version of Node.js.

## Example: Building and Pushing a Docker Image

Here’s an example of a workflow that builds a Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub:

```yaml
name: Build and Push Docker image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

    - name: Log in to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Build and push
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
      with:
        context: .
        push: true
        tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/my-repo:latest
```

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **name**: The name of the workflow.
2. **on**: Specifies the event that triggers the workflow. This workflow runs on a push to the `main` branch.
3. **jobs**: Defines the build job.
4. **steps**: Lists the steps to be executed in the job.
5. **uses**: Specifies an action to use. Actions can be from the GitHub Marketplace or defined within the same repository.
6. **with**: Provides inputs to the action. For example, `username` and `password` for `docker/login-action`.

## Secrets Management

- **GitHub Secrets**: Securely store sensitive information such as credentials. You can add secrets in your repository’s settings under `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
- In the above example, `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` are secrets.

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions provides a flexible and powerful way to automate tasks in your development workflow. By defining workflows in YAML files, you can automate testing, building, and deploying your applications directly from your GitHub repository. With its wide range of available actions and integrations, GitHub Actions can significantly streamline your CI/CD pipelines.
